# Project Plan

## Summary
This projects aims to build an application intended for Android and iOS devices including mobile devices and smartwatches.  It will track connected bluetooth devices and alert the user when a tracked device has disconnected  or reconnected to bluetooth. The app is intended to be used to track any bluetooth device, but focused on mobile, smartwatch, and Tile devices.

## Organization

### MBA

## Process
The process will be broken into 6 phases or milestones of development where each phase will act like a sprint in an Agile Method.  The length of each sprint will vary depending on the phase and adjustments made by members of the project.

1. Requirements Gathering
2. High Level Design
3. Low Level Design
4. Development
5. Testing
6. Deployment

### **Requirements Gathering**
*Goal*: Measure client requirements and specifications against developer capabilities. Outline exactly what each expectation will be for every part of the project.

*Duration*: Initial requirements gathering will take place over a conference call.  Requirement adjustments or addition will continue to occur throughout the development process.

### **High Level Design**
*Goal*: Achieve an understanding of the projects processes in a basic sense without any code being written.  This will include low fidelity prototypes, platform delivery, project architecture, and requirements refinement.

*Duration*: Predicted to take one week to achieve.  Can be adjusted as needed.

### **Low Level Design**
*Goal*: Become more specific with processes within the project. Describes *how* each part of the project will work. High fidelity prototypes may be created. Requirements will continue to be adjusted as needed.

*Duration*: Predicted to take 2-3 weeks to complete.

### **Development**
*Goal*: Development of the application for mobile devices.  Focused on creating a basic model to showcase to clients.  Bug tracking will also take place during this phase.  Requirements will continue to be adjusted as needed.

*Duration*: Predicted to take 4-5 weeks to complete.  Can be adjusted as needed.

### **Testing**
*Goal*: Both developer and client testing will occur to fix bugs within the application and make changes where they are needed.  Developer testing will focused on Black Box testing while client testing will focus on White Box testing.

*Duration*: Predicted to take 4 weeks to complete.  Can be adjusted depending on results of testing.

### **Deployment**
*Goal*: Introduce the application to end users.  Application will be placed on the App Store for iOS devices and the Google Play Store for Android users.

*Duration*: Predicted to take 2 weeks to complete.  Can be adjusted as needed.

### **Maintenance**
*Goal*: Continue to provide maintenance and updates per the client wishes.

*Duration*: Until no longer required.

## Policies
- Primary Form of communication between team members will be through email.
- Meetings are held via Skype or conference calls once per week.
- The main technologies will be Xamarin.Forms and GitHub.
- Progress will be tracked using GitHub

## Glossary
**Black Box Testing:** Software testing that examines functionality of an application without peering into its internal structures or workings.

**White Box Testing:** Software testing that examines functionality of an application by peering into its internal structure and coding.
