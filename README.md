## Version Control
I will be using GitHub to manage version control.  Different branches may be implemented to accommodate development, testing, etc.

## Tool Stack & Set Up Procedure
The following toolstacks are installed on my own device.  All tools are updated to their most recent versions.
- **[Xamarin.Forms  ](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin/xamarin-forms)**: This will be used to create the front end of the app
- **[DotNet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)**: This will be used to implement the back end of the app
- **[Git](https://github.com/Septimis)**: Version Control Software
- **draw.io**: Diagram drawing tool

## Build Instructions
Coming soon...

## System Testing
For each requirement, the developer will test functionality and fix bugs when found.  Outside users will also be used to implement testing.
