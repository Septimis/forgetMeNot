## Version Control
I will be using GitHub to manage version control.  Different branches may be implemented to accommodate development, testing, etc.

## Tool Stack & Set Up Procedure
The following toolstacks are installed on my own device.  All tools are updated to their most recent versions.
- ** Xamarin.Form **: This will be used to create the front end of the app
- ** DotNet **: This will be used to implement the back end of the app
- ** Git **: Version Control Software
- ** draw.io **: Diagram drawing tool

## Build Instructions
Coming soon...

## System Testing
For each requirement, the developer will test functionality and fix bugs when found.  Outside users will also be used to implement testing.
